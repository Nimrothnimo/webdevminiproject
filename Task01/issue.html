  <h1>Issue</h1>
  <br>
  
 <p> In our community, discarding waste in public spaces and natural 
  water sources is extremely painful, as is removing trees
  , putting more smoke-emitting vehicles on the streets, and
   releasing more noise on the roadways via vehicles. Such activities can also be observed. This has an impact on the natural environment, natural water bodies, air, and the organisms that rely on them. It also causes a range of diseases when the temperature rises.This kind of activities are taking place in our village. It is very regrettable that our future generations are affected by this.
  What is the solution for this?
